The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized several categories of speech that are given lesser or no protection by the First Amendment and has recognized that governments may enact reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions on speech. The First Amendment's constitutional right of free speech, which is applicable to state and local governments under the incorporation doctrine, only prevents government restrictions on speech, not restrictions imposed by private individuals or businesses unless they are acting on behalf of the government. However, laws may restrict the ability of private businesses and individuals from restricting the speech of others, such as employment laws that restrict employers' ability to prevent employees from disclosing their salary with coworkers or attempting to organize a labor union. newlinechar  newlinechar *** newlinechar  newlinechar ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] newlinechar ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28\",\n",

Fortunately goodreads does.  newlinechar  newlinechar Here's my [latest bingo card](https://imgur.com/a/PaGaKyX), a few updates, but not much in terms of filling squares. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This month I read: newlinechar  newlinechar **SiX Wakes by Mur Lafferty** - Easily 5 star reading. Isolated crew members on a generation ship wake up to find their previous bodies murdered, and their mental backup is from before the ship set off, oh right, they're all clones. As they try to figure out who the murderer is, and it could even be themself, they each become increasingly paranoid and things start going off the rails. We slowly construct their backstory leading to why they are each on the ship, the history &amp; cultural influence of clones and their complicated personal experiences as one. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **Graveyard Shift by Angela Roquet** - A story about a reaper set almost entirely in a peaceful, multicultural afterlife! The first half is solidly mundane fantasy, I loved all the day to day and infrastructural bits, the 2nd half things become more plotty trying to solve things going wrong with reapings and some secret missions and danger. Very fun.  newlinechar  newlinechar **Black Dog by Dave McKean** - This is non-fiction, but I think it goes here because it is a bit of a surrealism graphic novel, while also being a hard hitting biography about a war artist suffering from PTSD and grief. newlinechar  newlinechar **Artificial Condition by Martha Wells** - Even better than the first. Murderbot makes so many friends! newlinechar  newlinechar **Uncharted by Kevin J Andersen and Sarah A Hoyt** - A pulpy frontier explorer fantasy, following Lewis &amp; Clark on their journey west from St. Louis at the behest of renowned sorcerer Benjamin Franklin, in a dark magic filled world. newlinechar  newlinechar **City of Lost Fortunes by Bryan Camp** - Fantasy set in mondern new orleans post-katrina. Our protagonist has the power to find lost things, but after the storm he can hardly tap into it without crushing himself from the overwhelming loss, he manages to leverage it just enough to get by, or not quite. One day his debt is calle din by a trickster god, and he winds up at a supernatural card game playing with fates. A must read for fans of American Gods/Anansi Boys. newlinechar  newlinechar **The Merry Spinster by Mallory Ortberg** - A dark/creepy fairytale re-telling collection, a random library pickup that I wound up loving pretty much every one.  newlinechar  newlinechar **The Calculating Stars by Mary Robinette Kowal** - Another one I knew was 5 stars pretty much right away and it thoroughly delivered. A meteorite hits earth, we follow a couple who are both scientist as they first deal with surviving it, then the impact (teheh) on their lives, finally become involved with an international effort to verify it's effects and get into space as a result. In the course of this effort, Elma, a former WASP pilot and mathematician quickly finds despite her qualifications she's ruled out from going into space, taking on a public agitation role she becomes a female face for STEM and vocal about the need for lady astronauts - all the while racked with social anxiety.  newlinechar  newlinechar I also knocked out two audiobook memoirs, **Thanks for All the Money by Joel McHale** and **A Life in Parts by Bryan Cranston**.\",\n",

The Enemy, or those who have become like him, go newlinechar in for 'machinery' – with destructive and evil effects — because 'magicians', who have become newlinechar chiefly concerned to use magia for their own power, would do so (do do so). The basic motive for newlinechar magia – quite apart from any philosophic consideration of how it would work – is immediacy: newlinechar speed, reduction of labour, and reduction also to a minimum (or vanishing point) of the gap newlinechar between the idea or desire and the result or effect. But the magia may not be easy to come by, and newlinechar at any rate if you have command of abundant slave-labour or machinery (often only the same thing newlinechar concealed), it may be as quick or quick enough to push mountains over, wreck forests, or build newlinechar pyramids by such means. Of course another factor then comes in, a moral or pathological one: the newlinechar tyrants lose sight of objects, become cruel, and like smashing, hurting, and defiling as such. It newlinechar would no doubt be possible to defend poor Lotho's introduction of more efficient mills; but not of newlinechar Sharkey and Sandyman's use of them* newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;*Anyway, a difference in the use of 'magic' in this story is that it is not to be come by by 'lore' or newlinechar spells; but is in an inherent power not possessed or attainable by Men as such. Aragorn's 'healing' newlinechar might be regarded as 'magical', or at least a blend of magic with pharmacy and 'hypnotic' processes. newlinechar But it is (in theory) reported by hobbits who have very little notions of philosophy and science; newlinechar while A. is not a pure 'Man', but at long remove one of the 'children of Luthien'.* newlinechar  newlinechar **-Letter 155**\",\n",

He hasnt even come close to hitting his ceiling either, he almost certainly has a chance to hit to be a top3-5 receiver this season as he's guaranteed 150 targets. Dont be surprised if he puts up 100/1300/8-10 TDs. There's not many fantasy receivers more consistent than Thomas\",\n",

The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized several categories of speech that are given lesser or no protection by the First Amendment and has recognized that governments may enact reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions on speech. The First Amendment's constitutional right of free speech, which is applicable to state and local governments under the incorporation doctrine, only prevents government restrictions on speech, not restrictions imposed by private individuals or businesses unless they are acting on behalf of the government. However, laws may restrict the ability of private businesses and individuals from restricting the speech of others, such as employment laws that restrict employers' ability to prevent employees from disclosing their salary with coworkers or attempting to organize a labor union. newlinechar  newlinechar *** newlinechar  newlinechar ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] newlinechar ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28\",\n",

Murderbot makes so many friends! newlinechar  newlinechar **Uncharted by Kevin J Andersen and Sarah A Hoyt** - A pulpy frontier explorer fantasy, following Lewis &amp; Clark on their journey west from St. Louis at the behest of renowned sorcerer Benjamin Franklin, in a dark magic filled world. newlinechar  newlinechar **City of Lost Fortunes by Bryan Camp** - Fantasy set in mondern new orleans post-katrina. Our protagonist has the power to find lost things, but after the storm he can hardly tap into it without crushing himself from the overwhelming loss, he manages to leverage it just enough to get by, or not quite. One day his debt is calle din by a trickster god, and he winds up at a supernatural card game playing with fates. A must read for fans of American Gods/Anansi Boys. newlinechar  newlinechar **The Merry Spinster by Mallory Ortberg** - A dark/creepy fairytale re-telling collection, a random library pickup that I wound up loving pretty much every one.  newlinechar  newlinechar **The Calculating Stars by Mary Robinette Kowal** - Another one I knew was 5 stars pretty much right away and it thoroughly delivered. A meteorite hits earth, we follow a couple who are both scientist as they first deal with surviving it, then the impact (teheh) on their lives, finally become involved with an international effort to verify it's effects and get into space as a result. In the course of this effort, Elma, a former WASP pilot and mathematician quickly finds despite her qualifications she's ruled out from going into space, taking on a public agitation role she becomes a female face for STEM and vocal about the need for lady astronauts - all the while racked with social anxiety.  newlinechar  newlinechar I also knocked out two audiobook memoirs, **Thanks for All the Money by Joel McHale** and **A Life in Parts by Bryan Cranston**.\",\n",
